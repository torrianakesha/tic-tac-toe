# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Pairs

A fun and modern twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game!  
Instead of placing Xs and Os directly, players flip cards to find matching pairs. When a player finds a match, they claim a square. The goal is still the same — get **three in a row** to win!

Built with **Next.js 15, React, and Tailwind CSS**.
